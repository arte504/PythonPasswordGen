# Python Password Genetator
## By Artyom Shlyusberg aka arte504

## Description
- This my first project in Python to create a password between 6 to 16 figures.
- By now it doesn't save it to file and only work from 6 up to 16 figures, will make it work up to 32 in the future.
- Maybe I'll create UI to this program when I'll learn to do it properly ;p
